                <span class="highlight">Zoning</span> reform in Metro Boston is vital for tackling systemic inequities and advancing environmental justice. By reevaluating policies like <span class="highlight">single-family zoning</span>, which historically segregate and limit housing access for marginalized communities, we can break down barriers disproportionately affecting these populations. Our project uses data-driven visuals to underscore the urgency of zoning reform in promoting environmental justice. As discussions on the <span class="highlight">H.3138 Affordable Homes Act</span> unfold, our visualization aims to persuade policymakers to prioritize zoning reform for climate resilience and equity.
