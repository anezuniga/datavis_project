                Zoning reform holds immense potential in addressing systemic inequities and promoting environmental justice within the Metro Boston Area. At the heart of this issue lies the concept of single-family zoning, a policy that historically perpetuates socioeconomic segregation and restricts housing accessibility for marginalized communities. By reevaluating and reforming such zoning regulations, planners and policymakers can dismantle barriers that disproportionately affect environmental justice populations. These populations often reside in neighborhoods characterized by lower median household incomes, higher proportions of minorities, and limited English proficiency, as identified by the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. Through data-driven visualizations, this project aims to highlight the importance of zoning reform in promoting environmental justice through illustrated visualization.

                Given the context of the bond bill and the upcoming legislative sessions through July 2024 to discuss the H.3138 Affordable Homes Act, our visualization is meant to serve as an aid to show policymakers the importance of supporting zoning reform to support climate resilience for environmental justice populations. By advocating for policy adjustments informed by empirical evidence, planners and community development advocates can champion initiatives that prioritize equity and inclusivity. Through actionable insights and policy recommendations, this visualization project seeks to galvanize stakeholders to challenge the status quo, foster meaningful dialogue, and spearhead tangible reforms that address the root causes of environmental injustice in the Metro Boston Area.
