    <p>
        The relationship between single family zoning, parcels data and environmental justice populations were explored by looking more closely at four different municipalities in the MAPC region. 
    </p>


    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p><strong>Municipality: Hanover</strong></p>
    </div>
    <figure class="image_all">
        <img src="figures/Hanover.svg" alt="Hanover">
        <figcaption style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;"> Hanover was chosen because it is a 100% single family zoning municipality. However, Hanover has a small portion of the environmental justice population.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p><strong>Municipality: Bolton</strong></p>
    </div>
    <figure class="image_all">
        <img src="figures/Bolton.svg" alt="Bolton">
        <figcaption style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;">Bolton was also chosen because it is a 100% single family zoning municipality. However, Bolton has no environmental justice population.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p><strong>Municipality: Cambridge</strong></p>
    </div>
    <figure class="image_all">
        <img src="figures/Cambridge.svg" alt="Cambridge">
        <figcaption style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;">Cambridge was chosen because it is a 0% single family zoning municipality but there are a lot of single family parcels and a lot of them are concentrated around Harvard where there are no environmental justice populations. However, Cambridge does have a lot of environmental justice population compared to municipalities that have single family zoning.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p><strong>Municipality: Newton</strong></p>
    </div>
    <figure class="image_all">
        <img src="figures/Newton.svg" alt="Newton">
        <figcaption style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;">Newton was chosen because it is a 77% single-family zoning municipality and according to analysis and the map there are a lot more single-family residences in Newton which is zoned for 77% for single-family zoning than Hanover and Bolton that have 100% single-family zoning.</figcaption>
    </figure>
     
    <p>
        Based on these analysis a main takeaway is that most of the environmental justice populations are concentrated where there are not alot of single family zoning and single family residence. To better support the environmental justice population we can create zoning reforms. There is an immediate need for changing the zoning from single family zoning to include “missing middle” types of housing and also allowing An accessory dwelling unit (ADU) to be built in places where single family houses have already been built. ADUs are smaller, independent residential units that are located on the same parcel as the single family home but it is detached from the house. This can  increase the supply of housing and meet the demand of the people as well as increase housing affordability in the MAPC region.
