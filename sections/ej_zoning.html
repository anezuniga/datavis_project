    This analysis shows a clear negative correlation between the presence of EJ populations and single-family housing.
    Combined with the majority of housing being devoted to single-family residences, this makes housing especially
    precarious for these vulnerable populations.

    The relationship between single family zoning, parcels data and environmental justice populations are further explored by looking more closely at four different municipalities in the MAPC region.

<!--
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p><strong>Municipality: Hanover</strong></p>
</div>
<figure class="image_all">
    <img src="figures/Hanover.svg" alt="Hanover">
    <figcaption style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;"> Hanover was chosen because it is a 100% single family zoning municipality. However, Hanover has a small portion of the environmental justice population.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p><strong>Municipality: Bolton</strong></p>
</div>
<figure class="image_all">
    <img src="figures/Bolton.svg" alt="Bolton">
    <figcaption style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;">Bolton was also chosen because it is a 100% single family zoning municipality. However, Bolton has no environmental justice population.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p><strong>Municipality: Cambridge</strong></p>
</div>
<figure class="image_all">
    <img src="figures/Cambridge.svg" alt="Cambridge">
    <figcaption style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;">Cambridge was chosen because it is a 0% single family zoning municipality but there are a lot of single family parcels and a lot of them are concentrated around Harvard where there are no environmental justice populations. However, Cambridge does have a lot of environmental justice population compared to municipalities that have single family zoning.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p><strong>Municipality: Newton</strong></p>
</div>
<figure class="image_all">
    <img src="figures/Newton.svg" alt="Newton">
    <figcaption style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;">Newton was chosen because it is a 77% single-family zoning municipality and according to analysis and the map there are a lot more single-family residences in Newton which is zoned for 77% for single-family zoning than Hanover and Bolton that have 100% single-family zoning.</figcaption>

    Based on this analysis a main takeaway is that most of the environmental justice populations are concentrated where
    there are not alot of single family zoning and single family residence. To better support the environmental justice
    population we can create zoning reforms. There is an immediate need for changing the zoning from single family zoning to
    include “missing middle” types of housing and also allowing accessory dwelling units (ADUs) to be built in places where
    single family houses have already been built. ADUs are smaller, independent residential units that are located on the
    same parcel as the single family home but it is detached from the house. This can increase the supply of housing and
    meet the demand of the people as well as increase housing affordability in the MAPC region.
