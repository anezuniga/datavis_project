                    Since the 1970s, suburban zoning policies have worsened racial and socioeconomic segregation, with regulations like large lot requirements and minimum multifamily zoning excluding lower-income families and people of color. Originally aimed at controlling density and inflating housing prices, these rules persist today, limiting affordability and rental options, particularly for African American and Latino communities and family households.
