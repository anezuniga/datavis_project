                    The Federal Housing Administration institutionalized racism by utilizing redlining (1934-1968)  for mortgage insurance requirements.

                    Since the 1970s, suburban zoning policies have worsened racial and socioeconomic segregation, with regulations like large lot requirements and minimum multifamily zoning excluding lower-income families and people of color. Originally aimed at controlling density and inflating housing prices, these rules persist today, limiting affordability and rental options, particularly for African American and Latino communities and family households.

  This analysis shows a clear negative correlation between the presence of EJ populations and single-family housing. Combined with the majority of housing being devoted to single-family residences, this makes housing especially precarious for these vulnerable populations.

  The following visualizations illustrate the relationship between single-family zoning, parcels data, and environmental justice populations in four different municipalities in the MAPC region.

    <div class="municipalities-description" id="rightText">Cambridge is labeled as a 0% single-family municipality, but it actually has numerous single-family parcels, especially around Harvard, where there are no environmental justice populations. However, Cambridge does have a substantial environmental justice population compared to municipalities with single-family zoning.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<script src="interactive_towns.js"></script>

<p>
  Based on this analysis a main takeaway is that most of the environmental justice populations are concentrated where
  there are not a lot of single family zoning and single family residence. To better support the environmental justice
  population we can create zoning reforms. There is an immediate need for changing the zoning from single family zoning to
  include “missing middle” types of housing and also allowing accessory dwelling units (ADUs) to be built in places where
  single family houses have already been built. ADUs are smaller, independent residential units that are located on the
  same parcel as the single family home but it is detached from the house. This can increase the supply of housing and
  meet the demand of the people as well as increase housing affordability in the MAPC region.

  <h2>Datasets</h2>
  <ul style="text-align: justify;">
      <li><strong>Single Family Zoning Dataset:</strong>This dataset, derived from MAPC's Zoning Atlas and integrating data from diverse sources, provides a comprehensive understanding of housing zoning dynamics and demographic profiles within the Metro Boston area. It combines spatial and tabular data pertaining to zoning districts within the 101 municipalities of the MAPC region, specifically focusing on Metro Boston, categorizing areas based on whether they are designated solely for single-family housing or for other types of housing.The dataset also aggregates demographic and income data from census sources, offering insights into population characteristics and household incomes within these zoning areas. MassGIS contributes municipal boundary data, defining the geographical extents of each municipality, while the census boundary areas are from the year 2010. Demographic information, including population distribution and ethnicity, is sourced from the US Census and ACS, with general population and housing characteristics by blocks from the US Census in 2010. Additionally, income data from the ACS, aggregated at the block group level, is from the years 2014-2018. There are some rows for some municipalities to show municipalities that have only single-family zoning and other housing zoning.</li>

      <li><strong>Environmental Justice (EJ) Populations Dataset:</strong> This dataset, curated by the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) in Massachusetts, sheds light on areas designated as Environmental Justice (EJ) populations across the state, focusing on the year 2020. Derived from a combination of Census block group data and American Community Survey (ACS) estimates, it identifies regions meeting specific criteria indicative of environmental justice concerns. These criteria encompass factors such as minority population representation, median household income levels, and household English language proficiency. Block groups with total populations below 50 were excluded to maintain data quality. The dataset provides a detailed understanding of the spatial distribution of EJ populations, facilitating informed decision-making and targeted interventions to address environmental disparities. Municipal boundaries sourced from MassGIS delineate the geographical extent of each municipality, while demographic information, including population demographics and household income levels, is aggregated from the US Census and ACS data. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and community advocates striving to promote environmental equity and justice in Massachusetts.</li>

      <li><strong>MAPC Parcel Dataset Description:</strong>The MAPC Parcel Dataset provides a comprehensive understanding of land parcel dynamics within the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) region, focusing on zoning information and property characteristics. Derived from the MA Land Parcel Dataset and incorporating diverse sources, this dataset integrates spatial and tabular data related to parcels across 101 municipalities within the MAPC area. Key attributes include parcel identifiers, facilitating unique parcel identification and spatial analysis. Detailed property valuation data, including building value, land value, and total assessed value, offer insights into property valuations and economic profiles. Additionally, zoning information such as zone code, zone name, and zone use type provides crucial information on land use regulations and zoning designations. Property characteristics such as year built, building area, and number of units offer further insights into the physical attributes of properties. Furthermore, derived attributes such as zoned density and actual density allow for analysis of compliance with zoning regulations. Municipal boundary data from MassGIS delineate the geographical extent of each municipality, while zoning data provides information on zoning districts within which properties lie. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for urban planning, real estate analysis, and policy development within the MAPC region, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning efforts.
